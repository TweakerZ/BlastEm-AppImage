# BlastEm-AppImage
BlastEm AppImage.

I was looking for an appimage, couldn't find one, so I made one using the binaries from the official site.

[BlastEm](https://www.retrodev.com/blastem/ "BlastEm - The fast and accurate Genesis emulator") is an open source and highly accurate emulator for the Genesis/Megadrive developed by Mike Pavone.
